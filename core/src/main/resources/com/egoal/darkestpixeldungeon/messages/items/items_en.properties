items.artifacts.handleofabyss.desc-real=It was once a longsword named "abyss". There remains part of the will of a warrior. It's unclear if it’s the master of the abyss, or just the power that is trapped inside.\nThe break is neat as new. It's mystrious what kind of opponent it was facing at the last time. It is bound to be a battle in the annals of history. Maybe one day you will know its past exploits.

items.books.textbook.callysdiary.page0=Bonfire month, xx year\nJessica insisted I would fail... No, impossible! I will prove myself, she is just stupid and shortsighted...Just wait and see, Jessica, I will go back with treasure and change our fortune!\n\nFirstfrost month, xx year\nHumph... This dungeon is not as dangerous as imagination though it's hard at first look. That guy Sodan is a coward, how should he look down upon me? Coward-out-and-out!
items.books.textbook.callysdiary.page1=Firstfrost month, xx year\nDarkness and chill is coming at me as I go deeper into this dungeon and I feel a bit cold... No, Cally! Don't forget your originality! Come on, keep going, you can do it, you can do it.\n\nFirstfrost month, xx year\nNo... I'm going to collapse... There are innumerable undeads. My food is running out, my power is going downhill. Oh no, my dear Jessica, how I wish I could go back... God, please forgive my recklessness, I beg you to bless me to come back to her again......

Come, darkness and curse... Wish god bless her... bless her......

items.books.textbook.yvettesdiary.page0=This is the end I think, the end.\nNot clear about this feeling... I've been trapped... for about three days. I'm starving and seldom think.\n\nAll of a sudden I wish I hadn't blocked the door... at least I could end up in fight rather than ending up such cowardly.\nWhat I will like after my end? Ah, probably the same to those remains. And afterwards other adventurers may be curious about what's hidden here, just like I rummage other remains for treasure... Huh, that's so ridiculous...
items.books.textbook.yvettesdiary.page1=Would there be other adventurers pass by before my end? Oh... no, who knows what they would do? They might save me, but they would probably rob me for treasure. Er what I'm thinking about... don't know what I'd wrote on and off... Ah, it's totally meaningless. Who would notice this paper, who would care what I wrote, and who would help me send it? Huh why are you still believing illusion?... Anyway it's your choice and it's no use to plaint now...
items.books.textbook.yvettesdiary.page2=But there is still something suspicious... I have tried this key on countless door locks but it had never matched one... I'm not sure about the reason, this key probably matches a mystery room on deeper, deeper floors...
